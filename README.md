Help biological and foster parents learn to parent children together.

We're reframing foster care: instead of the foster parents taking children away from their biological parents, foster parents help the biological parents train to be better parents when theyâ€™re reunited with their children.

#### The Narrative
Ana Gutierrez has three children: Macia (8), Gladys (4), Jon (2). 
Francisco DuBuque - Macia's dad - isn't around, but Gladys and Jon's dad Joshua Reyes is helping Ana work through a court-ordered anger management program and reunite with her children.

Two families are fostering Ana's children until she completes the program.
Jon and Gladys are with Wendy Chadwick, while Macia is with Brianna Winter.
The Winters are also fostering another child - Jaylan Hudson - while his parents Samara and Francis find housing again.

Tianna Reilly is the social worker for both the Gutierrez and Hudson families.  She wants to help the Winters and Chadwicks be effective foster parents to the children. She also wants to help Ana, Joshua, Samara, and Francis maintain their relationships with their children, improve their parenting skills, and reunite their families.

Tianna invites the foster parents and biological parents to use Coparenting. This will let them:

- keep in touch with the Foster Parents, if they're willing (without publicizing personal contact details)
- propose events where they can meet with their children (once court-approved)
- get invitations form the Foster Parents to join important events in the children's lives (e.g., doctor's appointments)
- share their knowledge about the children's preferences, routines, and anything else that can help the Foster Families support their children
- stay involved with what happens in their children's lives during the removal
- learn techniques from the Foster Parents that can help them be the best parents they can once they're reunited with their children
  
As they Biological Parents and Foster Families chat, share updates, ask questions, and meet up, Tianna can monitor the conversation to see what works well, where there's room for more improvement, and how the Coparents can make the reunification a success.
